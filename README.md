# Music Venue


## Technologies used:
React, react-reveal

## Summary 
The Music Venue is a website promoting an upcoming concert for a famous artist. The application is an excercise in fundamental React features, including creating resuable components, passing in props, creating stateless and stateful components, and using React third party components to create a beautiful and engaging looking webpage. 

## Things I learned:

1. How to use react-reveal to include awesome animations such as zoom, fade, slide, etc.
2. How to use props as a way to build on resuable components.
3. How to create a sidebar countdown feature.
4. Integrating 3rd party embed code (Google Maps).
5. How to use sidebar effectively to direct a link click to a certain section of a webpage.

## Steps I took:
1. Installed all dependencies I would need.
2. Deleted some pre-included files and images from create-react-app that I would not need.
3. Started creating components, beginning with navbar. 
4. Included link navigation options in sidebar to send user to particular area of site.
5. Included a React Slick component and used it to display photos of Ariana Grande from resources folder.
6. Coded venue and date information, and implemeneted Zoom feature along with duration and delay.
7. Created components for pricing and Highlights including discount with Zoom feature. 
6. Embeded Google Maps location for the venue.
